  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to
  # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is
  # activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your
  # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
  # rules and activating additional ones.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/images/drawer-images/
    - assets/images/vendor Detail Images/
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SatoshiRegular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/Fonts/Satoshi-Regular.otf
    - family: SatoshiLight
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/Fonts/Satoshi-Light.otf
    - family: SatoshiMedium
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/Fonts/Satoshi-Medium.otf
    - family: SatoshiBold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/Fonts/Satoshi-Bold.otf


  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
